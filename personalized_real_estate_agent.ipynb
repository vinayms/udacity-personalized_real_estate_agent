    "This following code snippet demonstrates the use of the langchain library for evaluating word embeddings. First, it sets the OpenAI API key to authenticate with OpenAI services. Then, it initializes an embedding function from the OpenAIEmbeddings class. The embedding function is used to generate vector representations for the words \"new york\". These vectors represent the semantic meaning of the words in a multi-dimensional space. Next, it loads an evaluator from the langchain library specifically designed for pairwise embedding distance comparison. The evaluator is then employed to compare the vectors of two words, \"new york\" and \"nyc\". The comparison assesses the similarity between the semantic meanings of the two words based on their respective vectors. Finally, the code prints out the result of the comparison, providing insights into the semantic relationship between the words."
